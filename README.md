To The Core – A Minecraft Modpack for Aspiring IT Minds

To The Core is a learning-focused Minecraft modpack (version 1.16.5) designed to introduce young, tech-savvy individuals to the fundamentals of IT, automation, energy systems, and programming.
It combines technical complexity with hands-on exploration and is best suited for use in schools, IT training centers, and self-paced learners.

This project is built on the RTFM Principle (Read The "Fantastic" Manual), fostering problem-solving through exploration and documentation.

🧠 Educational Philosophy

The goal of To The Core is to bridge the gap between theoretical IT education and the real skills needed in practice, such as:

    Automation thinking

    Programming logic (Lua)

    Documentation literacy (RTFM)

    Energy systems and efficiency

    Creative problem-solving

📘 Example Use Cases

    Vocational IT training

    Project-based learning in digital classrooms

    IT clubs and gifted student programs

    Self-guided IT exploration
